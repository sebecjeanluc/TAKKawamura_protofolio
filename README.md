## Roadmap

- [] When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- [] When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- [] When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- [] When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- [] When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- [] When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
